# My ML Model (Cog + Replicate)

This repository contains a machine learning model packaged with [Cog](https://github.com/replicate/cog) for easy reproducibility and deployment on [Replicate](https://replicate.com/).

## Features
- **Local Testing** on CPU or GPU (via Docker + Cog).
- **Automatic Deployment** to Replicate for serverless inference.
- **Inpainting / YOLO Detection / Text2Img** (modify to describe your modelâ€™s primary function).
